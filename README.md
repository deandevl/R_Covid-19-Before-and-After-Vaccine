# R_Covid-19-Before-and-After-Vaccine
An R based multiplot of Covid-19 deaths by race before and after universal adult vaccine eligibility as reported by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/28/us/covid-deaths.html). Plots were produced using R language based package [RplotterPkg](https://github.com/deandevl/RplotterPkg).

This repository was inspired by the article [Starting 2022 Off With A Fairly Complex {ggplot2} Recreation Plot](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/01/starting-2022-off-with-a-fairly-complex-ggplot2-recreation-plot/?utm_source=phpList&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=R-bloggers-daily&utm_content=HTML) by [hrbrmstr](https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/hrbrmstr/) in [RBloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).
